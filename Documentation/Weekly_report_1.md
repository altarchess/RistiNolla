# Week 1

[Hour reporting](https://github.com/altarchess/RistiNolla/blob/main/Documentation/Hour_reporting.md)

## What happened during week 1?
* Communication protocol design
* Research on possible positional evaluation.
* Design document

## What was learned?
* Horizon effect problems can be very serious, much more serious than in other games such as chess, as there can be many forced sequences that do not lead anywhere, pushing the win/loss outside of the horizon. 
* many move ordering heuristics used for other games such as chess will not work due to the tactical nature of the game, killer moves etc might still work. 

## Next week
Coding, coding, coding...
A working engine would be cool.
