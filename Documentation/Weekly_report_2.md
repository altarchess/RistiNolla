# Week 2
[Hour reporting](https://github.com/altarchess/RistiNolla/blob/main/Documentation/Hour_reporting.md)

## What happened during week 2?
* Decided to just update evaluation terms move by move & also do the same with a list of possible moves. I think this is cleaner & more efficient than the aproach I previously thought of.
* Started coding, communication, board class, etc.
* A lot of just figuring out how to do all the move generation & evaluation stuff efficiently, I think it's very important to get right.

Unfortunately, I didn't get nearly as much done this week as I should have.

## Next week
Gotta setup the testing & work harder on the project in general
