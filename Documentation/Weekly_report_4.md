# Week 4
[Hour reporting](https://github.com/altarchess/RistiNolla/blob/main/Documentation/Hour_reporting.md)

## What happened during week 3?
* Wrote the basic GUI that allows for human vs human, engine vs human, as well as engine vs engine play.
* Wrote a simple User Guide for the potential peer review.
* Commented all the previously uncommented code.

## Issues & Questions
* Should I do unit testing for the GUI too (even though it's not really a part of the main program)? I've done unit testing in python during a previous course, so it shouldn't take too much time.
* Looking at doctest for unit testing with cpp, but as I have no previous experience it's a bit confusing, I'm sure I'll manage tho.

## Next week?
Testing, Documentation & hopefully start improving on negamax.
